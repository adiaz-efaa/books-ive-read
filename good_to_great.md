# Good to Great

Qué permite que una buena compañía se transforme en una gran compañía.

"Here, then, is an overview of the framework of concepts ... Think of the transformation as a process of buildup followed by breakthrough, broken into three broad stages: disciplined people, disciplined thought and disciplined action."

- The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: "Those who launch revolutions, dramatic change programs, and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap from good to great."
  - Disciplined people
      - Level 5 leadership
      - First who ... then what
  - Disciplined thought
      - Confront the brutal facts (yet never losse faith)
      - The hedgehog concept (Simplicity within the three circles)
  - Disciplined action
      - A culture of discipline
      - Technology accelerators

## Level 5 Leadership

Not leadership, but a special kind of leadership.

### Level 5 Hierarchy

| Level| Summary| Description|
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | Highly capable individual| Makes productive contributions through talent, knowledge, skills and good work habits.|
| Level 2| Contributing team member| Contributes individual capabilities to the achievement of group objectives and works effectively with others in a group setting.|
| Level 3| Competent Manager| Organized people and resources toward the effective and efficient pursuit of predetermined objectives.|
| Level 4| Effective Leader| Catalyzes commitment to and vogorous pursuit of a clear and compelling vision, stimulating higher performance standards.|
| Level 5| Level 5 Executive | Builds enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will.|

### What is Level 5

|  Professional Will | Personal Humility  |
|---|---|
| Creates superb results, a clear catalyst in the ttransition from G2G.| Demonstrates a compelling modesty, shunning public adulation; never boastful.|
| Demonstrates an unwavering resolve to do whatever must be done to produce the best long term results, no matter how difficult.| Acts with quiet, calm determination; relies principally on inspired standards, not inspiring charisma, to motivate.|
| Sets the standard of building an enduring great company; will settle for nothing less.| Channels ambition into the company, not the self; sets up successors for even greater success in the next generation.|
| Looks in the mirror, not out the window, to apportion responsibility for poor results, never blaming other people, external factors, or bad luck.| Looks out the window, not in the mirror, to apportion credit for the success of the company; to other peole, external factors and good luck.|

### Key Points

- Every G2G company had Level 5 leadership during the pivotal transition years.
- Level 5 refers to a five level hierarchy of executive capabilities, with Level 5 a t the top. Level 5 leaders embody a paradoxical mix of personal humility and professional will. They are ambitious first and foremost for the company,  not themselves.
- Level 5 leaders set up their successors for even grater success in the next generation, whereas egocentric Level 4 leaders often set their successors for failure.
- Level 5 leaders display a compelling modesty, are self-effacing (not claiming attention for oneself; retiring and modest) and understated. In contrast, two thirds of the comparison companies had leaders with gargantuan personal egos that contributed to the demise or continued mediocrity of the company.
- Level 5 leaders are fanatically driven, infected with an incurable need to produce sustained results. They are resolved to do whatever it takes to make the company great, no matter how biog or hard the decisions.
- Level 5 leaders display a workmanlike diligence, more plow horse than show horse.
- Level 5 leaders look out the window to attribute success to factors other than themselves. When things go porrly, however, they look in the mirror and blame thenselves, taking full responsibility. The comparison CEOs often did just the opposite, they looked in the mirror to take credit for success, but out of the window to assign blame for disappointing results.

## First Who ... Then What

"When we began the research project, we expected to find that the first step in taking a company from G2G would be to set a new direction, a new vision and strstegy for the company, and then go to get people committed and aligned behind that new direction."

"We found something quite the opposite."

"The executives who ignited the transformations from G2G did not first figure out where to drive the bus and then get people to take it there. No, they *first* got the right people on the bus (and the wrong people off the bus) and *then* figured out where to drive it."

### Key Points

- The G2G leaders began the transformation by first getting the right people on the bus (and the wrong people off the bus) and then figured aout where to drive it.
- This is *not just* the idea of getting the right people on the team. The ky point is that "who" questions come before "what" decisions; before vision, before stratategy, before organization structure, before tactics. *First* who, *then* what, as a rigorous discipline, consistently applied.
- The comparison companies frequently followed the "genius with a thousand helpers" model, a genius leader who sets a vision and then elists a crew of highly capable "helpers" to make the vision happen. This model fails when the genius departs.
- The G2G leaders where rogorous,not ruthless, in people decisions. They did not rely on layoffs and restructuring as a primary strategy for improving performance. The comparison companies used layoffs to a much greater extent.
- Three practical disciplines for being rogorous in people decisions were uncovered:
	- When in doubt, don't hire, keep looking. (Corollary: a company shoukd limit its growth based on its ability to attract enough of the right people.)
	- When you know you need ato make a people change, act. (Corollary: First be sure you don't simply have someone in the wrong seat.)
	- Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not you biggest problems. (Corollary: If you sell off your problemas, don't sell off your best people.)
	- G2G management teams consist of people who debate vogorously in search of the best answers, yet who unify behind decisions, regardless of parochial interests.
